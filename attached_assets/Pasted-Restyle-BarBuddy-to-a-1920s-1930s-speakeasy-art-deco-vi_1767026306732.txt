Restyle BarBuddy to a 1920s–1930s speakeasy / art-deco vibe: deep dramatic colors, brass accents, elegant typography, subtle texture, and polished components. Keep the app mobile-first and accessible (contrast, readable font sizes). Do not change business logic; only theme/UI.

A) THEME TOKENS (GLOBAL)
Implement a centralized theme system (CSS variables or Tailwind theme) with:
- Background: near-black / deep charcoal
- Surfaces/cards: deep green or oxblood with subtle contrast
- Primary accent: brass/gold
- Secondary accent: cream/ivory
- Muted text: warm gray
- Danger: deep red (not neon)
- Success: deep emerald (not neon)
Add variables for:
--bg, --surface, --surface2, --text, --muted, --border,
--accent, --accent2, --danger, --success,
--shadow, --radius, --focus

B) COLOR PALETTE (SUGGESTED)
Use these as defaults (can adjust slightly for contrast):
- bg: #0B0B0D (near-black)
- surface: #121216
- surface2: #181820
- text: #F2E9D8 (ivory)
- muted: #B9B1A2 (warm gray)
- border: rgba(242,233,216,0.12)
- accent (brass): #C6A15B
- accent2 (champagne): #E3CFA3
- danger: #8B2C2C
- success: #1F6B4A

C) TYPOGRAPHY
- Headings: art-deco inspired (e.g., “Cinzel” or similar available web font)
- Body: readable serif/sans blend (e.g., “Cormorant Garamond” or “Inter” for body if needed)
Rules:
- Use headings sparingly; keep body readable.
- Increase letter spacing slightly on headings for deco feel.

D) COMPONENT STYLING
Update all main components:
1) Top nav + tabs:
- Dark background with brass active indicator
- Subtle bottom border
2) Buttons:
- Primary: brass fill, dark text
- Secondary: transparent with brass border
- Destructive: deep red with ivory text
- Hover/focus: gentle glow (not neon)
3) Cards:
- Deep surface with subtle gradient + thin brass edge (very subtle)
- Softer shadows; use warm highlights
4) Inputs:
- Dark input background with ivory text
- Brass focus ring
5) Chips/tags:
- Dark surface with brass outline; selected = brass fill
6) Tables/lists:
- Zebra with subtle contrast; dividers in warm translucent border
7) Modals:
- Dark overlay; modal surface with brass header line

E) ICONOGRAPHY + DETAILS (SUBTLE)
- Use simple line icons; accent color brass.
- Add subtle texture option:
  - A faint noise overlay or paper grain on background (very low opacity).
- Add a small “art deco” divider style (thin lines, small geometric motif) for section headers.

F) PAGE-SPECIFIC POLISH
1) Home dashboard:
- Hero header with speakeasy title treatment
- Primary CTAs as large brass buttons
2) Cocktail detail:
- Recipe section with deco dividers
- Smoker controls styled like a “control panel” with brass toggles
3) Favorites/People/Settings:
- Consistent dark cards, brass highlights, readable spacing

G) ACCESSIBILITY & QA
- Ensure contrast meets WCAG for text on dark surfaces.
- Ensure focus states are visible (brass ring).
- Ensure buttons and chips have clear selected states.

H) OPTIONAL: LIGHT/DARK TOGGLE
Keep speakeasy as default theme. If a theme toggle exists, keep it but ensure speakeasy is primary.

DELIVERABLE:
A cohesive 1920s–1930s speakeasy/art-deco theme applied across the entire app with consistent tokens, updated components, and improved polish, without changing functionality.
