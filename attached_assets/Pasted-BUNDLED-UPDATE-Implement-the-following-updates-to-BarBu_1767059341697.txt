BUNDLED UPDATE: Implement the following updates to BarBuddy in one cohesive release. Keep all existing core features working. Focus on new UI sections, seed data, and integration hooks into existing smoker/tuning/recommendation systems.

========================================================
1) EDUCATION TAB (NEW TOP-LEVEL TAB)
========================================================
Add a new top-level navigation tab: “Education”.

Education sections/pages:
A) Smoke Basics
- Explain: smoke is aroma-first; lighter woods = elegance; stronger woods = bitterness risk.
- Reinforce global smoked cocktail guardrails (smoke glass default, bitters reduction, dash caps, time ranges, rest time, lingering smoke too much).
- Explain how smoke interacts with sweetness, acidity, bitterness, dilution, and spirit-forwardness.

B) Wood Flavor Guide (dynamic, wood-by-wood)
- For each wood in the user’s wood library (built-in + custom), show:
  - Aroma notes (nose)
  - Taste effect (palate)
  - Best drink tags + best food tags
  - Common mistakes + quick fixes
  - “Try this” suggestions (1–2 drink style ideas)
- Pull content from wood profile fields (purpose, tastingNotes, flavorTags, affinities) and add a short curated summary per intensity category.

C) What to Look For (sensory checklist)
- “Green flags” vs “Red flags”
- Nose/palate/finish checklist: clean vs ashy, drying tannin vs harsh bitterness, flat vs lifted, spirit presence.

D) Fix It (troubleshooting + one-tap actions)
- Problems:
  - Too smoky
  - Too bitter
  - Flat/dull
  - Too sweet
  - Too sharp/hot
  - Can’t taste spirit
  - Ashy/sooty
- Each shows:
  - Why it happens
  - Fix options (specific and short)
  - “Apply Fix” button:
    - If there’s an active cocktail session, update suggested smoke settings and show updated steps
    - Otherwise create a Tuned Variation with Before→After explanation (using existing tuning/variation system)

E) Guided Experiments (mini flights)
- Add 3–4 small guided tastings:
  - Fruitwood flight (Apple vs Cherry vs Pear) on one base drink
  - Clean vs Bold (Alder vs Hickory) with strict time caps + warnings
  - Wine-like spritz smoke (Pear vs Grapevine) for wine-leaning drinkers
  - Optional dessert flight (Maple vs Pecan)
- Each experiment: setup, what to notice, how to log results, and “save preferred smoke settings”.

Education integration links:
- On wood picker: “Learn what this wood does”
- On smoked toggle: “Smoke basics”
- On troubleshooting chips: link to Fix It

========================================================
2) SMOKER DEVICE TYPES (CHIMNEY PRIMARY, CLOCHE SUPPORTED)
========================================================
Add Smoker Type support with device-aware instructions everywhere.

A) Settings → Smoker
Add Smoker Type selector (enum):
- Chimney / Top-Mounted (Aged & Charred-style)  <-- default
- Cloché / Dome
- Smoking Gun (handheld)
- Torch-only (chips + torch)

Store per-user default: smokerType.
Add per-session override via “Quick Switch” dropdown on:
- Smoker page
- Guided Smoke start screen

B) Device-aware instructions
Update:
- Smoker page
- Guided Smoker Mode steps
- Education → Smoke Basics (device type mini section)
to show correct wording for the selected device type.

C) Chimney / Top-Mounted workflow (primary)
- Emphasize smoke GLASS default.
- Wood amount guidance: “small pinch / avoid overpacking”
- Torch: “steady smoke flow, not roaring”
- Capture timer uses wood profile + intensity slider within guardrails
- Rest timer 20–30s
- Pour + garnish; suggest citrus expression if flat
- Add cleaning tip to avoid stale/ashy smoke.

D) Cloché / Dome workflow
- Ignite wood on tray/board, trap smoke under dome
- Timer + rest
- Avoid long capture; note small volume and quicker saturation

E) Method restrictions remain
- Smoke glass default
- Garnish-only woods force garnish method
- Smoke cocktail only for high-proof/stirred with warning
- Enforce caps: Hickory ≤8s, Mesquite ≤7s, Oak ≤12s
- Enforce bitters reduction and max dashes for smoked drinks

========================================================
3) WOOD LIBRARY EXPANSION + USER-ADDED WOODS + ADAPTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS
========================================================
A) Seed additional woods (editable defaults; enabled by default)
Add these to the wood library with filled metadata (purpose, tastingNotes, flavorTags, affinities, beginnerSafe, intensity, time ranges):
- Pear (light, 12–16s): elegant/floral; spritz/gin; foods: cheese/salads/light
- Peach (light, 12–16s): stone-fruit; summer; foods: grilled chicken/fruit desserts
- Walnut (medium-strong, 8–12s): nutty/dry/earthy; OF/amaro/vermouth; foods: roasted meats/mushrooms
- Olive (medium, 8–12s): savory/mediterranean; martini/mezcal riffs; foods: lamb/grilled veg
- Beech (light-medium, 10–14s): clean/neutral; versatile; foods: poultry/seafood/cheese
- Grapevine (medium, 8–12s): tannic/structured; negroni/vermouth/wine-like; foods: charcuterie/steak
- Rosemary (garnishOnly, 5–8s): herbal/pine; gin/citrus; foods: lamb/roasted veg
- Cinnamon (garnishOnly, 5–8s): warm spice; bourbon/rum/winter; foods: desserts/holiday

B) User-added wood profiles
Ensure UI supports Add/Edit/Delete custom wood profiles with fields:
- name, intensity, time min/max, purpose, tastingNotes, flavorTags,
  bestWithDrinkTags, bestWithFoodTags, avoidWithDrinkTags, beginnerSafe, isInMyKit,
  methodRestriction optional, optional costPerUse (only when cost tracking enabled)

C) Adaptive “AI” scoring (deterministic + learning)
- Update wood recommendation logic to include ALL woods (built-in + custom).
- Score woods by tag matches (drink + meal + flavorTags) and person preferences.
- Learning only re-ranks defaults within guardrails:
  - Store per-person wood affinity based on made history ratings + feedback (too smoky/just right) + tuning actions.
- Respect garnishOnly method restrictions automatically in UI and guided flow.

========================================================
4) GARNISH LIBRARY (NEW) + RECOMMENDATIONS + “FIX WITH GARNISH”
========================================================
Add a “Garnishes” section (either as part of Inventory or within Smoker/Settings) with a user-manageable garnish library.

A) Seed a default garnish set:
Citrus:
- Orange peel, Lemon peel, Grapefruit peel, Lime peel
Herbs:
- Rosemary, Thyme, Mint, Sage
Spices:
- Cinnamon stick, Star anise, Clove, Nutmeg (grated)
Fruits:
- Luxardo/brandied cherry, Dehydrated orange wheel, Dehydrated lemon wheel, Blackberry
Savory:
- Olive, Cocktail onion (pickled)
Rims:
- Smoked salt, Demerara sugar, Chili-salt, Cocoa-sugar

B) Garnish fields:
- name
- category (citrus/herb/spice/fruit/savory/rim)
- flavorTags (bright, herbal, warm spice, savory, sweet accent, drying, etc.)
- bestWithDrinkTags
- bestWithWoods (optional)
- smokeFriendly (boolean) and recommended smoke method/time if true
- notes

C) UI + behavior
- On cocktail detail pages:
  - Show recommended garnishes (ranked) based on drink tags + selected wood + person preferences
  - Offer “Add garnish to my notes” and “Use for Fix”
- On Fix It page:
  - Add a “Fix with a garnish” section:
    - Flat/dull → suggest citrus expression or herb
    - Too smoky → fresh citrus oil/herb lift
    - Too sweet → citrus oil + optional bitters (still respects caps)
    - Too bitter/ashy → citrus oil + shorter smoke next time

========================================================
