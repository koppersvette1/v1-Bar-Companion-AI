Expand the smoker “Wood Library” and wood selection UI to include the additional wood profiles we discussed, and ensure they participate in recommendations and learning.

A) Seed these additional woods (editable defaults, enabled by default unless noted):
- Pear (light, 12–16s): elegant fruit/floral, wine-like spritz and gin; foods: cheese/salads/light dishes
- Peach (light, 12–16s): stone-fruit summer sweetness; spritz/sours; foods: grilled chicken/fruit desserts
- Walnut (medium-strong, 8–12s): deep nutty/dry/earthy; OF/amaro/vermouth; foods: roasted meats/mushrooms
- Olive wood (medium, 8–12s): savory/mediterranean/earthy; martini-style, mezcal riffs; foods: lamb, olives, grilled veg
- Beech (light-medium, 10–14s): clean/european/neutral; versatile; foods: poultry/seafood/cheese
- Grapevine (medium, 8–12s): wine-barrel adjacent, tannic/structured; negroni/vermouth/wine-like; foods: charcuterie/steak
- Rosemary (garnishOnly, 5–8s): piney/herbal aroma; gin/citrus; foods: lamb/roasted veg
- Cinnamon (garnishOnly, 5–8s): warm spice aroma; bourbon/rum/winter; foods: desserts/holiday

B) Ensure fields exist and are filled:
- intensity
- time min/max
- purpose
- tastingNotes
- flavorTags (chips)
- bestWithDrinkTags
- bestWithFoodTags
- avoidWithDrinkTags
- beginnerSafe
- methodRestriction (garnishOnly for rosemary/cinnamon)

C) UI Updates:
- In Settings → Smoker → Wood Library:
  - show all woods (original 8 + these new ones)
  - allow enable/disable, edit, add custom wood profile
- In cocktail pages wood picker:
  - include the new woods (respect methodRestriction)
  - show “why this wood” and recommended time
  - if garnishOnly wood selected, automatically set method to garnish smoke and disable other methods with an explanation

D) Recommendation + Learning:
- Update wood scoring to include these new woods automatically (no hardcoding to 8).
- Ensure learning can build affinity for these woods per person.

Deliverable:
New woods appear in the wood library and smoker selection UI, behave correctly with method restrictions, and are used in recommendations/learning.
