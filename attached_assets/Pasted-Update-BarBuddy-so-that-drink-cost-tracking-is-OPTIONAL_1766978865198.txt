Update BarBuddy so that drink cost tracking is OPTIONAL and controlled by a global user setting.

A) GLOBAL USER SETTING
Add a per-user setting:
- enableCostTracking (boolean, default false)

Place this setting in:
- Profile / Settings page
Label:
- “Enable drink cost tracking”
Helper text:
- “Estimate cost per drink and per batch using your bottle prices. You can turn this on or off anytime.”

B) BEHAVIOR WHEN COST TRACKING IS OFF (DEFAULT)
When enableCostTracking = false:
- Do NOT prompt for prices when adding bottles.
- Hide all cost-related UI:
  - cost per drink
  - cost breakdowns
  - shopping cost summaries
  - batch cost totals
- Inventory items do not show price fields.
- Receipt OCR and pricing providers are disabled/hidden.
- The app behaves exactly like a non-cost-tracking cocktail app.

C) BEHAVIOR WHEN COST TRACKING IS ON
When enableCostTracking = true:
1) Inventory
- Show optional price fields:
  - purchase price
  - bottle size
  - store (Total Wine, BevMo, Other)
- Show computed cost per oz/ml.
- Add an “Unpriced items” filter.

2) Add Bottle Flow
- After barcode/OCR/manual add, show a NON-BLOCKING prompt:
  - “Want to add a price for cost estimates?”
  - Buttons: “Add price” | “Skip”
- Skipping does NOT nag the user again for that item.

3) Cocktail Pages
- Show “Estimated cost per drink” with expandable breakdown.
- If some ingredients lack prices:
  - Show “Partial estimate” + list missing inputs.
  - Provide one-tap “Add price” actions.

4) Smoked Cocktails
- If smoked=true, include wood dust/chip cost per use in the breakdown.
- If wood cost is missing, show it as optional.

5) Batch Mode
- Show total batch cost and per-drink cost only when cost tracking is enabled.

D) SETTINGS UX
- Settings page sections:
  - General
  - Smoker
  - Cost Tracking
- Cost Tracking section includes:
  - Enable cost tracking toggle
  - Short explanation of how costs are calculated
  - Button: “Manage default garnish & consumable costs” (only visible if enabled)

E) DATA SAFETY
- Turning cost tracking OFF:
  - Does NOT delete stored prices.
  - Simply hides cost UI and calculations.
- Turning it back ON restores all previous pricing data.

F) README UPDATE
Document:
- Cost tracking is optional and off by default.
- How to enable it.
- What data is stored when enabled.
- That retailer prices are user-entered or imported via receipts (no scraping).

Deliverable:
- A clean, optional cost system that never blocks core cocktail functionality and respects the user toggle everywhere in the app.
